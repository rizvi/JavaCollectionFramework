**Find all points within a certain distance of another point.**

Find points(Given X, Y coordinates) which are within a certain distance of another point.
The distance and the central point is specified as an argument to the function which computes the points in range.

**Example:** All points within a distance 10 of (0,0) will include the point at (3,4) but not include the point at (12, 13)

What I have to do?

Suppose there is a circle, center is (0, 0). Radius 10. You have given some points.
 Which points are within the circle?
